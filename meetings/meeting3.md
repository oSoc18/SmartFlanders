## Comments
### OASIS
- including pulic transport would be a nice feature too
- link idcard or parkingcard to buildings
- use user feedback to avoid that buildings give false information about accessibility
- use wikipedia as identifiers
- zoom in as much as possible

### SmartFlanders
- watch out for difficult buildings with multiple addresses
- vocabulary:
  buildingunits =/= buildings
  data: building has address
  info: where is entrance of building
- find public toilets attached to public buildings, with accessibility label
- start with cityhalls
- idea to give snippet is great
- check wikipedia/dbpedia for extra metadata
- maybe add toeristinfo, historic info, ...
