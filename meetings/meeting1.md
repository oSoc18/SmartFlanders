# Meeting 1

*Date*: 03/07/2018
*People*: OASIS, SmartFlanders, both coaches & Flemish goverment

## Coach Brecht proposal

1. Search engine for URI for every building
2. Convince cities to generate a catalog for their data with a tutorial
3. Make a combined overview of all the data for the 13 centre cities. Which data is common, which is not?
4. Map everything from Aalst to Linked Data (nice-to-have, OASIS is MVP)
5. Demostrator of the data, see Wednesday (4th of July): people from ToeVla will explain some problems they have (OASIS).

## Flemish goverment people

### Data providers

- ToeVla: Toerisme Vlaanderen, several data resources about tourism in Flanders and their accessibility
- OnWheels: Accessibility data for building measured by voluteers
- Aalst: Public domain data
- Antwerp & Turnhout: unknown data dumps at the moment

If we want more data, we should ask the organisations as quickly as possible (holiday season will be here soon).

### SmartFlanders

They want to encourage cities to publish their data in a structured and organized way.
That means:

- Linked Data, every city stays decentralized for providing data in an effcient way
- Open Data, accessible for anyone
- No XLS, CSV, databases, Rest API, ... but one structured manner to publish the data

So much data is available, we should focus on the data that's most used by people on ToeVla, OnWheels, ...

### OASIS

The goal of OASIS is to use the Linked Data and do something usefull with it.
This should convince the cities what is possible when they publish their data as Linked Data.


## Expectations

### SmartFlanders

Focus on the data needed by OASIS and start by creating a list of building URI's.
If that's working, we can add more meta data to every building.

### OASIS

As soon as the list of buildings is available, we can start building an OpenStreetMap map with every building.
Adding more data later is possible and depends on which data is mostly used from ToeVla and other providers.
