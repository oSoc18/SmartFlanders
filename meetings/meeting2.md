# Meeting #2

## SmartFlanders
First of SmartFlanders wants to help citizens to access public buildings. They will be doing this by publishing the data as open linked data. In order
to help the citizins they figurerd that a tutorial would be the most helpful solution. Existing tutorials are too big, boring and complex. SF will build it's own
tutorial that is easy to follow and contains quizes.
SF will also focus on accessibility data. That data is already published but in the wrong formats and without a clear structure. In order to be able to really
combine the existing datasets linked open data is the only viable option.

### Planning
1. Explore each dataset.
2. Map the vocabulary on the dataset.
3. Pubish a part of the dataset as linked data.
4. Write an introduction to loked data.
5. Complete tutorial with examples.

## OASIS

Trying to solve the issue that concerns people in a wheelchair who are trying to use public buildings. Often they are misinformed concerning the accissbility of that building. Two big datasets already exist.
1. Toevla
2. On wheels

They both have their own problems and therefor it could be usefull to combine that data and visualize it using a map. This map will be build with accessibility chaining in mind.

## Partner comments

- OASIS: (What data will be used, and will it use data at all?): Yes, OASIS plans to use the data provided by SmartFlanders.
- SmartFlanders: (not really a tutorial is needed but maybe a guide): Both can be combined but the purpose should still be make it usefull for the Flemish government itself.
- SmartFlanders: (What is your audience): Very general, because most governement agencies do use consultants who already are up to date with linked data.
- OASIS: (How will you do chain of accessibility): There is no solution.
- General: (Will city data be used): No not planned .
- Smartflanders: Try to look at the Nederlands, they are more advanced and may be able to help.
- General: It would be nice if there could be a visual poc using data from the cities -> SmartFlanders should use data from the cities.
- Smartflanders: Convincing that cities should use JSON-LD on their website so that the information is publically available.
